# (Prosper Loan Data)
## by (Mahmoud Sallam)


## Dataset

 Prosper was founded in 2005 as the first peer-to-peer lending marketplace in the United States. Since then, Prosper has facilitated more than $18 billion in loans to more than 1,100,000 people.
 
 This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others

I made a subset from the dataset contains the columns  
the borrowerâ€™s APR - the loan amount - Term(The length of the loan expressed in months) - MonthlyLoanPayment - ProsperRating -  ListingCategory - BorrowerStat - EmploymentStatus - IsBorrowerHomeowner - DebtToIncomeRatio - StatedMonthlyIncome  
this new dataset was between 2009-07-20 and 2014-03-12   
i decided to work on the employees only as they have the majority of loans and i wanted the invistigation to be consistant.
